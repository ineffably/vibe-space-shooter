# Progress

## Current Status

We have completed the initial setup of the project and implemented the core game architecture. The development server is running and we can see a blank game screen.

## What Works

- Memory bank documentation is complete with:
  - Project specifications
  - Architecture plans
  - Technical context
  - Development roadmap
- Basic project structure:
  - Initialized with Vite TS template
  - Set up project directories
  - Installed core dependencies (Pixi.js v8.9)
  - Configured ESLint
- Core framework components:
  - Game class with main loop
  - Scene management system
  - State machine for entity behaviors
  - Input handling system
  - Asset loading structure
  - Base entity class

## What's Left to Build

### Phase 1: Project Setup
- [x] Initialize the project with Vite TS CLI
- [x] Install required dependencies
- [x] Set up basic project structure
- [x] Configure ESLint

### Phase 2: Core Game Engine
- [x] Create main game loop
- [x] Implement asset loading system
- [x] Set up basic scene management
- [x] Create input handling system

### Phase 3: Game Entities
- [ ] Implement player ship with movement and shooting
- [ ] Create finite state machine implementations for entity behaviors
- [ ] Implement enemy ships with AI behavior
- [ ] Implement projectile system
- [ ] Create background star system

### Phase 4: Game Mechanics
- [ ] Implement collision detection
- [ ] Create health and damage system
- [ ] Add scoring system
- [ ] Implement lives system
- [ ] Create explosion effects

### Phase 5: UI and Polish
- [ ] Add score and lives display
- [ ] Create game over screen
- [ ] Implement game restart functionality
- [ ] Add sound effects
- [ ] Polish visuals and gameplay

## Known Issues

- Need to check if assets are loading correctly
- Need to implement actual game entities

## Evolution of Project Decisions

- Implemented the core architecture using singleton pattern for managers (SceneManager, InputManager, AssetLoader)
- Created a clear separation between game logic and rendering through the entity and scene system
- Used a state machine approach for entity behaviors as specified in the requirements
