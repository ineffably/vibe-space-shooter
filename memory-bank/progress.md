# Progress

## Current Status

We have implemented the core game architecture, the player ship with movement and state machine behaviors, a projectile system with object pooling, enemy ships with AI behaviors, collision detection between projectiles and ships, scoring system, and game over functionality. The game now has a functional gameplay loop with enemies that spawn at increasing frequencies, can be destroyed for points, and can damage the player. We recently fixed critical issues with texture loading, enemy spawning, and projectile positioning.

## What Works

- Memory bank documentation is complete with:
  - Project specifications
  - Architecture plans
  - Technical context
  - Development roadmap
- Basic project structure:
  - Initialized with Vite TS template
  - Set up project directories
  - Installed core dependencies (Pixi.js v8.9)
  - Configured ESLint
- Core framework components:
  - Game class with main loop
  - Scene management system
  - State machine for entity behaviors
  - Input handling system
  - Asset loading structure with proper spritesheet texture extraction
  - Base entity class
- Player ship implementation:
  - Player movement with arrow keys
  - State machine with idle, moving, shooting, damaged, and destroyed states
  - Health and lives system
  - Screen boundary constraints
- Projectile system:
  - Projectile entity with states (active, exploding, inactive)
  - Object pooling for performance optimization
  - Different projectile types (player/enemy)
  - Automatic screen boundary detection
  - Integration with player shooting
  - Correct positioning relative to ship position
- Enemy system:
  - Enemy ships with different types
  - Random movement patterns
  - Shooting at the player
  - Taking damage and being destroyed
  - Spawning at increasing frequency
  - Proper texture rendering from spritesheet
- Game mechanics:
  - Collision detection between projectiles and ships
  - Health and damage system
  - Scoring system
  - Lives system
  - Game over and restart functionality
- UI elements:
  - Score display
  - Lives display
  - Game over screen with final score
  - Restart instructions

- [ ] Create explosion effects

### Phase 5: UI and Polish
- [x] Add score and lives display
- [x] Create game over screen
- [x] Implement game restart functionality
- [ ] Add sound effects
- [ ] Polish visuals and gameplay

## Known Issues

- Need to implement proper explosion effects for ships and projectiles
- Need to add sound effects for shooting, explosions, and game events
- Need to implement background stars effect for depth and motion
- The collision detection is using a simple distance-based approach rather than true hitbox collisions

## Evolution of Project Decisions

- Fixed critical issues with texture loading from spritesheets:
  - Implemented proper XML parsing in the AssetLoader
  - Added frame extraction for individual textures
  - Fixed texture debugging to help identify issues
- Fixed enemy ship and projectile positioning:
  - Correctly positioned projectiles to fire from ship centers
  - Fixed enemy ship texture rendering
- Fixed issues with Pixi.js v8.9 initialization by properly waiting for app.init() to complete
- Improved entity system with protected sprite access via public methods
- Implemented a state machine for player ship behaviors with 5 distinct states
- Switched from a complex asset loading system to a simplified solution for now
- Created an object pooling system for projectiles to optimize performance
- Used state pattern for projectiles to manage their lifecycle (active, exploding, inactive)
- Implemented enemy ships with three different visual types and random movement patterns
- Created a scoring system that rewards players for destroying enemies
- Added a game over and restart system to complete the gameplay loop
