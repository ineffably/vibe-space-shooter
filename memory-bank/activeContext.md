# Active Context

## Current Work Focus

We have successfully implemented the core game architecture and the player ship with movement and state-based behavior. The player ship can move around the screen using arrow keys and shoot (currently just console logging). We now need to implement the projectile system and enemy ships.

## Recent Changes

- Fixed Pixi.js v8.9 initialization issues with app.init() and canvas handling
- Simplified asset loading for now to focus on core gameplay
- Implemented player ship entity with:
  - Movement using arrow keys
  - Shooting with space bar (placeholder)
  - State machine for different behaviors (idle, moving, shooting, damaged, destroyed)
  - Health and lives system
  - Screen boundary constraints

## Next Steps

1. **Projectile System**
   - Create a Projectile entity class
   - Implement player projectiles that shoot upward
   - Add object pooling for performance
   - Create visual representation for projectiles

2. **Enemy Implementation**
   - Create enemy ship class with different types
   - Implement enemy movement patterns
   - Add enemy shooting behavior
   - Create enemy spawning system with increasing difficulty

3. **Collision System**
   - Implement collision detection between entities
   - Handle projectile-ship collisions
   - Create explosion effects on collision
   - Apply damage on collision

4. **UI and Scoring**
   - Add score display in the top-left corner
   - Show player lives remaining
   - Create game over screen
   - Implement game restart functionality

## Active Decisions

- We're using a state machine for entity behaviors to allow for complex interactions and easy extension
- Object pooling will be important for projectiles to avoid performance issues with frequent creation/destruction
- The player ship uses a component-based model with a container and sprite
- We'll need to implement proper collision detection that's efficient for the number of entities
- For now, we're using simple placeholder graphics until we implement proper asset loading

## Learnings and Insights

- Pixi.js v8.9 requires explicit async initialization with app.init() before accessing the canvas
- The state machine pattern makes it easy to manage different entity behaviors and transitions
- TypeScript's type system helps ensure consistent interfaces between components
- The component-based approach with containers and sprites provides good flexibility
- Protected properties in the base Entity class help enforce proper access patterns through public methods
