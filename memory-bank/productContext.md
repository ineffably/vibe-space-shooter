# Product Context

## Purpose
This project serves as a practical demonstration of game development using Pixi.js and TypeScript. It showcases how to build a classic arcade-style game with modern web technologies, implementing core game development patterns like game loops, sprite management, collision detection, and state machines.

## Problems Solved
1. **Learning Resource**: Provides a concrete example of Pixi.js v8.9 implementation in a complete game context
2. **Code Architecture Example**: Demonstrates how to structure a game with reusable components and patterns
3. **TypeScript Game Development**: Shows TypeScript's advantages in maintaining type safety in complex game logic
4. **State Management**: Illustrates practical implementation of finite state machines for game entities

## User Experience Goals
1. **Intuitive Controls**: Simple arrow key movement and shooting controls that feel responsive
2. **Clear Feedback**: Visual and audio feedback for all player actions and game events
3. **Appropriate Challenge**: Gradually increasing difficulty that keeps players engaged
4. **Immediate Gratification**: Satisfying explosions and score increases when defeating enemies
5. **Replayability**: Quick restart option that encourages "one more try" after game over

## Target Audience
- Developers learning game development with Pixi.js
- Casual gamers who enjoy classic arcade-style space shooters
- People interested in seeing practical examples of TypeScript game implementations

## Key Features from User Perspective
- Ship movement in all directions with intuitive controls
- Engaging combat with enemy ships
- Visual progression through increasing enemy frequency
- Satisfying feedback through explosions and sound effects
- Clear understanding of game state through UI elements
