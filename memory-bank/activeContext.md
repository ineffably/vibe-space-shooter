# Active Context

## Current Work Focus

We have implemented enemy ships, collision detection, scoring system, and game over functionality. The game now has a complete gameplay loop where players can shoot enemies, earn points, lose lives when hit, and restart when the game is over. We recently fixed critical issues with texture loading from spritesheets, enemy ship spawning, and projectile positioning.

We have successfully implemented proper textures for game entities and added explosion animations as specified in the spec. The player ship now uses the "playerShip1_blue" texture, enemy ships use the correct textures, and explosion animations play when ships are destroyed or projectiles collide.

We have also adjusted entity scaling to make ships appear at a more appropriate size, and implemented the enemy limits from the spec (maximum 10 enemies on screen, 3 active shots per enemy, and minimum shooting interval of 0.5 seconds).

We've also fixed a critical issue with player ship movement, adjusting the ship speed to 3.0 (down from the initial 300 which was too fast, and up from 0.3 which was too slow). This provides a balanced, responsive movement experience that feels right within the game environment.

Our current focus is on implementing the scrolling star background and adding sound effects to further enhance the gaming experience according to the spec.

## Recent Changes

- Fixed critical texture loading issue with Pixi.js v8.9:
  - Replaced incorrect baseTextureAsset.clone() approach with proper Texture constructor
  - Now using new Texture({ source: baseTextureAsset.source, frame: Rectangle }) for correct frame extraction
  - This resolved issues with player and enemy ship textures not appearing
- Adjusted entity scaling for better game feel:
  - Reduced player ship scale to 0.7
  - Reduced enemy ship scale to 0.6
- Fixed player ship movement:
  - Added debugging logs to input manager to verify key events
  - Fixed player ship movement speed (set to 3.0) for proper control responsiveness
  - Added debug logs to state machine transitions to diagnose movement issues
- Implemented enemy system limits from the spec:
  - Limited to maximum 10 active enemies on screen at once
  - Enforced minimum shooting interval of 0.5 seconds between shots
  - Limited each enemy to maximum 3 active shots at once
- Implemented proper textures and animations:
  - Updated player ship to use "playerShip1_blue" texture
  - Implemented ExplosionManager to handle explosion animations
  - Added sonic explosions for ship destruction
  - Added pixel explosions for projectile impacts
- Updated the asset loader to include all spritesheets:
  - Added support for pixel explosion spritesheet
  - Added support for sonic explosion spritesheet
- Fixed sprite and animation handling in Pixi.js v8.9:
  - Properly set sprite anchors for correct positioning
  - Improved entity positioning and projectile firing positions
  - Implemented proper animation frame handling
- Fixed critical asset loading issues:
  - Implemented proper XML spritesheet parsing in AssetLoader
  - Added detailed texture extraction from spritesheet frames
  - Fixed debugging to report available textures for troubleshooting
- Fixed enemy ship and projectile issues:
  - Corrected enemy ship textures to display properly
  - Fixed projectile positioning to fire from correct ship locations
  - Ensured enemies spawn and appear correctly on screen

## Next Steps

1. **Visual Effects (Current Priority)**
   - Create scrolling star background for depth and motion
   - Add visual feedback for damage
   - Add screen shake on significant events

2. **Sound Effects**
   - Add sound for shooting
   - Add sound for explosions
   - Add sound for taking damage
   - Add game over and restart sounds

3. **Gameplay Refinements**
   - Improve collision detection with proper hitboxes
   - Add difficulty progression
   - Add power-ups or bonuses
   - Add title screen and instructions

4. **Polish and Final Touches**
   - Refine animations and transitions
   - Optimize performance for weaker devices
   - Add additional sound effects for UI and game events

## Active Decisions

- Using explosion animations to enhance visual feedback
- Creating a reusable ExplosionManager to handle different explosion types
- Using the correct textures for all game entities as specified in the spec
- Creating scrolling star background instead of static black background
- Using simple circle-based collision detection for now
- Using state machines for all entity behaviors
- Managing projectiles through the owner entities for better organization
- Using a unified update loop through the scene hierarchy
- Creating individual textures from spritesheets by using proper Pixi.js v8.9 texture creation
- Ensuring projectiles spawn from the correct position on ships
- Implementing enemy limits (max 10 on screen) per updated spec
- Implementing enemy shooting frequency limits (min 0.5s between shots) per updated spec
- Implementing enemy active shots limit (max 3 active) per updated spec
- Adjusting entity scales for better visual balance
- Setting player ship movement speed to 3.0 for balanced, responsive control

## Learnings and Insights

- Explosion animations significantly enhance the game feel and feedback
- Proper texture implementation makes the game look much more polished
- Entity anchoring is critical for correct positioning and visual appearance
- Animation systems benefit from dedicated manager classes for reusability
- Proper asset implementation is crucial for the intended game experience
- All required textures must be specified in the asset manifest and loaded
- State machines make entity behavior management much cleaner
- Object pooling is essential for performance with many projectiles
- Hierarchical scene organization makes adding/removing elements easy
- Keeping game state in dedicated components makes restart functionality simpler
- TypeScript's type system helps catch errors early when refactoring
- Pixi.js v8.9 requires careful handling of spritesheet textures and frame rectangles:
  - The baseTextureAsset.clone() method doesn't exist in Pixi.js v8.9
  - Instead, must use new Texture({ source: baseTextureAsset.source, frame: rectangle })
  - This is a breaking change from earlier versions that causes silent failures
- Proper debugging of texture loading is crucial for troubleshooting rendering issues
- Positioning projectiles relative to their parent entity requires accounting for sprite anchor points
- Enemy system needs careful management to adhere to the specified limits and behaviors
- Visual scaling of entities has a big impact on gameplay feel and difficulty
- Player ship movement speed is critical for game feel:
  - Too fast (300) makes the game uncontrollable
  - Too slow (0.3) makes it frustrating to play
  - A balanced speed (3.0) provides responsive yet manageable control
