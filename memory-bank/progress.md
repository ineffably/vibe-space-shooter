# Progress

## Current Status

We have implemented the core game architecture, the player ship with movement and state machine behaviors, a projectile system with object pooling, enemy ships with AI behaviors, collision detection between projectiles and ships, scoring system, and game over functionality. The game now has a functional gameplay loop with enemies that spawn at increasing frequencies, can be destroyed for points, and can damage the player. We recently fixed critical issues with texture loading and implemented proper explosions and entity textures as specified in the spec.

We have also successfully fixed a critical issue with Pixi.js v8.9 texture creation by replacing the incorrect baseTextureAsset.clone() approach with the proper Texture constructor. This issue was causing textures not to appear despite being properly loaded. We've also adjusted entity scaling and implemented the enemy system limits required by the spec (max 10 enemies, min 0.5s shooting interval, max 3 active shots per enemy).

## What's Left to Build

### Phase 1: Animation and Visual Effects (High Priority)
- [ ] Create scrolling star background for the moving space effect
- [ ] Add visual feedback for damage
- [ ] Add screen shake for impacts

### Phase 2: Sound Effects (Medium Priority)
- [ ] Add sound effects for explosions and projectile firing
- [ ] Add sound effects for player damage and destruction
- [ ] Add UI sound effects (game over, restart)

### Phase 3: Gameplay Refinements (Medium Priority)
- [ ] Improve collision detection with proper hitboxes
- [ ] Add difficulty progression by adjusting enemy frequency and behavior
- [ ] Add power-ups or bonuses (if scope allows)
- [ ] Add title screen and instructions

### Phase 4: Polish and Final Touches (Lower Priority)
- [ ] Refine animations and transitions
- [ ] Optimize performance for weaker devices
- [ ] Add additional sound effects for UI and game events

## Known Issues

- Explosion frames might not load correctly if they follow a different naming pattern
- Background is a static black image rather than moving stars
- The collision detection is using a simple distance-based approach rather than true hitboxes
- Sound effects not implemented

## Evolution of Project Decisions

- Fixed critical texture loading issue with Pixi.js v8.9:
  - Discovered that baseTextureAsset.clone() is not a function in Pixi.js v8.9
  - Replaced with proper texture creation: new Texture({ source: baseTextureAsset.source, frame: rectangle })
  - This silent failure was causing textures not to appear despite being loaded
- Adjusted entity scaling for better game visuals:
  - Player ship scaled to 0.7 of original size
  - Enemy ships scaled to 0.6 of original size
  - Improves gameplay by making collision areas more appropriate
- Implemented spec requirements for enemy limitations:
  - Added filtering system to count active enemies and limit to 10 maximum on screen
  - Set minimum shooting interval to 500ms (0.5 seconds)
  - Added check to limit each enemy to 3 active projectiles at once
- Implemented proper textures for game entities:
  - Updated player ship to use "playerShip1_blue" texture
  - Ensured enemy ships use the correct textures
  - Used proper projectile textures for each entity type
- Implemented explosion animations:
  - Created ExplosionManager utility class to handle animations
  - Added pixel explosions for projectile impacts
  - Added sonic explosions for ship destruction
- Fixed texture handling for Pixi.js v8.9:
  - Updated the texture creation approach to use proper constructor
  - Fixed frame rectangles using the new approach
  - Ensured all game entities use the correct portions of sprite sheets
- Fixed critical issues with texture loading from spritesheets:
  - Implemented proper XML parsing in the AssetLoader
  - Added frame extraction for individual textures
  - Fixed texture debugging to help identify issues
- Fixed enemy ship and projectile positioning:
  - Correctly positioned projectiles to fire from ship centers
  - Fixed enemy ship texture rendering
- Fixed issues with Pixi.js v8.9 initialization by properly waiting for app.init() to complete
- Improved entity system with protected sprite access via public methods
- Implemented a state machine for player ship behaviors with 5 distinct states
- Created an object pooling system for projectiles to optimize performance
- Used state pattern for projectiles to manage their lifecycle (active, exploding, inactive)
- Implemented enemy ships with three different visual types and random movement patterns
- Created a scoring system that rewards players for destroying enemies
- Added a game over and restart system to complete the gameplay loop
