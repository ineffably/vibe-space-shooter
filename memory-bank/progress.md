# Progress

## Current Status

We have implemented the core game architecture and the player ship entity with movement and state machine behaviors. The development server is running and we can see and control the player ship on screen.

## What Works

- Memory bank documentation is complete with:
  - Project specifications
  - Architecture plans
  - Technical context
  - Development roadmap
- Basic project structure:
  - Initialized with Vite TS template
  - Set up project directories
  - Installed core dependencies (Pixi.js v8.9)
  - Configured ESLint
- Core framework components:
  - Game class with main loop
  - Scene management system
  - State machine for entity behaviors
  - Input handling system
  - Asset loading structure
  - Base entity class
- Player ship implementation:
  - Player movement with arrow keys
  - State machine with idle, moving, shooting, damaged, and destroyed states
  - Health and lives system
  - Basic shooting functionality (console logging only)
  - Screen boundary constraints

## What's Left to Build

### Phase 1: Project Setup
- [x] Initialize the project with Vite TS CLI
- [x] Install required dependencies
- [x] Set up basic project structure
- [x] Configure ESLint

### Phase 2: Core Game Engine
- [x] Create main game loop
- [x] Implement asset loading system
- [x] Set up basic scene management
- [x] Create input handling system

### Phase 3: Game Entities
- [x] Implement player ship with movement
- [x] Create finite state machine implementations for entity behaviors
- [ ] Implement projectile system
- [ ] Implement enemy ships with AI behavior
- [ ] Create background star system

### Phase 4: Game Mechanics
- [ ] Implement collision detection
- [ ] Create health and damage system
- [ ] Add scoring system
- [ ] Implement lives system
- [ ] Create explosion effects

### Phase 5: UI and Polish
- [ ] Add score and lives display
- [ ] Create game over screen
- [ ] Implement game restart functionality
- [ ] Add sound effects
- [ ] Polish visuals and gameplay

## Known Issues

- Asset loading is currently stubbed out - we're using placeholder graphics
- Fixed screen size values in player ship - these should be made dynamic
- Hidden/placeholder functions for spawning projectiles

## Evolution of Project Decisions

- Fixed issues with Pixi.js v8.9 initialization by properly waiting for app.init() to complete
- Improved entity system with protected sprite access via public methods
- Implemented a state machine for player ship behaviors with 5 distinct states
- Switched from a complex asset loading system to a simplified solution for now
