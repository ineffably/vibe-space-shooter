# Progress

## Current Status

We have implemented the core game architecture, the player ship with movement and state machine behaviors, a projectile system with object pooling, enemy ships with AI behaviors, collision detection between projectiles and ships, scoring system, and game over functionality. The game now has a functional gameplay loop with enemies that spawn at increasing frequencies, can be destroyed for points, and can damage the player. We recently fixed critical issues with texture loading and implemented proper explosions and entity textures as specified in the spec.

We fixed a critical time scale issue related to how Pixi.js handles deltaTime. We discovered that in Pixi.js, deltaTime values are in frames (approximately 1 per frame at 60fps) rather than actual seconds. This was causing our player respawn timer to run much faster than intended. We've updated all state timers to use consistent frame-based counting (120 frames = 2 seconds at 60fps) to fix this issue.

We have also successfully fixed a critical issue with Pixi.js v8.9 texture creation by replacing the incorrect baseTextureAsset.clone() approach with the proper Texture constructor. This issue was causing textures not to appear despite being properly loaded. We've also adjusted entity scaling and implemented the enemy system limits required by the spec (max 10 enemies, min 0.5s shooting interval, max 3 active shots per enemy).

We've fixed a player ship movement issue, fine-tuning the movement speed to a balanced 3.0 value that provides responsive yet controlled movement. This involved adding debug logs to diagnose input handling and state machine transitions.

We have implemented a scrolling star background that creates a parallax effect with stars of different sizes, speeds, and brightness levels moving from top to bottom. This creates the illusion of the player ship traveling forward through space and significantly enhances the visual appeal of the game as specified in the original requirements.

We've implemented a comprehensive sound system with sound effects for key game actions including laser shooting (both player and enemy), explosions (both small for projectiles and large for ships), player damage, game over, and UI interactions. Sound effects have been integrated into the relevant game systems, significantly enhancing the gaming experience.

Most recently, we've implemented a robust player respawn mechanism that addresses a key gameplay requirement. When the player ship is destroyed, it now waits for a random period of 3-6 seconds before respawning, creating a meaningful consequence for death while maintaining player engagement. After respawning, the player gets a temporary invulnerability period indicated by a flashing effect to prevent immediate destruction upon re-entry. This required significant enhancements to the entity update system and state machine to ensure proper operation during inactive states.

We've also extracted the reusable core components of our game into a separate framework called "SideQuest" and moved it from the src directory to the root level of the project. This creates a cleaner separation between game-specific code and reusable framework components, making it easier to maintain and potentially reuse the framework for future projects.

## Known Issues

- Explosion frames might not load correctly if they follow a different naming pattern
- The collision detection is using a simple distance-based approach rather than true hitboxes

## Evolution of Project Decisions

- Extracted SideQuest framework from game code:
  - Originally had game engine components mixed with game-specific code
  - Identified reusable patterns and components that could form a separate framework
  - Created a separate SideQuest directory structure at the root level
  - Updated build configuration (tsconfig.json and vite.config.ts) to support the new structure
  - Added path aliases for clean imports from the framework
  - This separation provides a cleaner architecture and potential for framework reuse
- Improved sound system with Howler.js:
  - Replaced HTML5 Audio API with Howler.js for more reliable audio playback
  - Simplified sound management with improved API and error handling
  - Added per-sound volume controls for better audio balance
  - Implemented better pause/stop control of sounds
  - Eliminated console.log spam for cleaner development
  - Added global mute/volume controls for easier audio management
  - Implemented more robust loading with automatic error handling
- Fixed player respawn time scale issues:
  - Discovered that Pixi.js deltaTime is in frames (typically ~1 per frame at 60fps)
  - Originally incorrectly assumed deltaTime values represented seconds
  - Updated all state timers from seconds to frame-based counting (120 frames = 2 seconds at 60fps)
  - Standardized timing approach across all player states (destroyed, invulnerable, damaged)
  - Updated timers to be consistently commented with both frames and time equivalents
  - Changed player respawn time from a random 3-6 seconds to a consistent 2 seconds (120 frames)
  - Changed invulnerability period to 3 seconds (180 frames) and flash interval to ~100ms (6 frames)
- Implemented robust player respawn mechanism:
  - Initially attempted to simply reset player position and make it active again
  - Found issues with state machine not updating during "inactive" phases
  - Modified Entity.update() to allow PlayerShip to override with custom behavior
  - Added random respawn delay (3-6 seconds) to create meaningful consequence for death
  - Implemented temporary invulnerability with visual flashing effect after respawn
  - Added safeguards to ensure player is properly reintegrated into the scene hierarchy
  - Enhanced collision detection to check player's invulnerability status
  - Added projectile clearing on respawn to prevent immediate damage
  - Improved debug logging throughout respawn sequence for troubleshooting
- Implemented sound effects system:
  - Created SoundManager singleton class to centralize audio handling

  - Stars have varying properties (size, speed, brightness, color) for visual appeal
  - Background properly resets and resizes with game state changes
  - Integrated with the game scene above the static black background
- Fixed player ship movement issues:
  - Initially implemented with speed 5, which was too slow with deltaTime
  - Increased to 300, which was far too fast for precision control
  - Reduced to 0.3, which was too slow for responsive gameplay
  - Finally settled on 3.0 for balanced, responsive movement
  - Added debug logs to player state transitions to diagnose movement issues
  - Added debug logs to input system to verify key event handling
- Fixed critical texture loading issue with Pixi.js v8.9:
  - Discovered that baseTextureAsset.clone() is not a function in Pixi.js v8.9
  - Replaced with proper texture creation: new Texture({ source: baseTextureAsset.source, frame: rectangle })
  - This silent failure was causing textures not to appear despite being loaded
- Adjusted entity scaling for better game visuals:
  - Player ship scaled to 0.7 of original size
