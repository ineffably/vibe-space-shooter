# Active Context

## Current Work Focus

We have implemented enemy ships, collision detection, scoring system, and game over functionality. The game now has a complete gameplay loop where players can shoot enemies, earn points, lose lives when hit, and restart when the game is over. We recently fixed critical issues with texture loading from spritesheets, enemy ship spawning, and projectile positioning. We need to focus on adding visual polish and sound effects to enhance the game experience.

## Recent Changes

- Fixed critical asset loading issues:
  - Implemented proper XML spritesheet parsing in AssetLoader
  - Added detailed texture extraction from spritesheet frames
  - Fixed debugging to report available textures for troubleshooting
- Fixed enemy ship and projectile issues:
  - Corrected enemy ship textures to display properly
  - Fixed projectile positioning to fire from correct ship locations
  - Ensured enemies spawn and appear correctly on screen
- Implemented enemy ship system:
  - Created an EnemyShip entity with state machine
  - Added different enemy types with random selection
  - Implemented enemy spawning with increasing frequency
  - Added enemy movement patterns and ability to shoot at player
- Added collision detection:
  - Implemented circle-based collision between projectiles and ships
  - Applied damage to ships on collision
  - Implemented explosion states when entities are destroyed
- Added scoring and game over system:
  - Track and display player score when destroying enemies
  - Implement player lives system with visual display
  - Added game over screen when all lives are lost
  - Implemented game restart functionality

## Next Steps

1. **Visual Effects**
   - Implement proper explosion animations for ships
   - Add visual feedback for damage
   - Create scrolling star background for depth and motion
   - Add screen shake on significant events

2. **Sound Effects**
   - Add sound for shooting
   - Add sound for explosions
   - Add sound for taking damage
   - Add game over and restart sounds

3. **Polish and Refinement**
   - Improve collision detection with proper hitboxes
   - Add difficulty progression
   - Add power-ups or bonuses
   - Add title screen and instructions

## Active Decisions

- Using simple circle-based collision detection for now
- Keeping visual effects minimal until core gameplay is solid
- Using state machines for all entity behaviors
- Managing projectiles through the owner entities for better organization
- Using a unified update loop through the scene hierarchy
- Creating individual textures from spritesheets by parsing XML frame data
- Ensuring projectiles spawn from the correct position on ships

## Learnings and Insights

- State machines make entity behavior management much cleaner
- Object pooling is essential for performance with many projectiles
- Hierarchical scene organization makes adding/removing elements easy
- Keeping game state in dedicated components makes restart functionality simpler
- TypeScript's type system helps catch errors early when refactoring
- Pixi.js v8.9 requires careful handling of spritesheet textures and frame rectangles
- Proper debugging of texture loading is crucial for troubleshooting rendering issues
- Positioning projectiles relative to their parent entity requires accounting for sprite anchor points
